accessibilityProblems:
  - At some point we display pages where the formatting for individual
    elements on screen are not fully suitable for screen reading technologies
    and results in a difficult to navigate page due to incomplete information.
    However using a screen reader to read back the entire page will provide
    all the information needed to navigate the page with confidence.
milestones:
  - description: We use a Barclaycard iFrame to take the card details and payments for
      the charge or tax users are paying. This iFrame does not give users the
      chance to confirm their details once they have entered them. This does
      not meet WCAG 2.1 success criterion 3.3.6.
